		<h2>Me</h2>
		<article>
			<p>This is me staring off into the distance.  
			I didnt' know that my picture was being taken at the time.
			I'm standing at the edge of a canyon in Canyonlands National Park.  
			I've been to the Grand Canyon as well, but I feel like
			this was more impressive.</p>

		<h2>My dad</h2>
		<article>
			<p>This is my dad.  He was the impetus for the trip.
			He's into nature a great deal.  Member of the Sierra club and everthing :)  
			I enjoy travelling with my dad.  He has an RV, which makes travelling much nicer</p>

		<h2>Nature Shot</h2>
		<article>
			<p>This is just a nature shot.  There was plenty of subject matter to choose from.  
			Utah is a beautiful state.  I've travelled pretty extensively in the USA and I think that Utah might be my favorite state.</p>
